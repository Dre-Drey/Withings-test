# Improvment

## Backend-oauth2

Step 1 : If I had more time I'd like to refactor a bit the code to clean some points : there is repetitions in the code like the isset() function which is repeted twice (one time to set the right button and one time to retrieve the data), and in the decode function for the $rsp, etc. I think we can do much shorter and effective.

I did the retrieving of the access token and the access to the Withing's API according to the documentation for the developers tests. The documentation give some CLI with curl and I think we could do different and more effecfive in PHP.

step 2 : as in step one, there is some repetition with the isset function.

## Frontend - React Quiz

With more time, I'd have done more CSS to improve the general display and the accessibility of the quiz.
I think we can improve some features as a timer, the questions number, disabled the buttons if we have validated the answers, etc.

I had hard time with the shuffle of the answers and I would have search longer with more time, rather than get a built function from stackoverflow.
